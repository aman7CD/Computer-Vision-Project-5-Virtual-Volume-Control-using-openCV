# Computer-Vision-Project-5-[Virtual Volume Control using openCV]
Used openCV, pycaw, ctypes, comtypes to control the volume of the pc through webcam.
## Modules used in the Project
### openCV
OpenCV is a Python library that allows you to perform image processing and computer vision tasks. It provides a wide range of features, including object detection, face recognition, and tracking.
### pycaw
Pycaw is a  Python Core Audio Windows Library, works for both Python2 and Python3.
### ctypes
ctypes is a foreign function library for Python. It provides C compatible data types, and allows calling functions in DLLs(dynamic link library for Windows) or shared libraries. It can be used to wrap these libraries in pure Python.
### comtypes
comtypes is a pure Python COM(Component Object Model) package based on the ctypes ffi(foreign function interface) foreign function library. ctypes is included in Python 2.5 and later, it is also available for Python 2.4 as separate download.

The comtypes package makes it easy to access and implement both custom and dispatch based COM interfaces.
